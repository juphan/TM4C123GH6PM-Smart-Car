# TM4C123GH6PM-Smart-Car
Obstacle avoidance car that uses the low-power TI TM4C123GH6PM Tiva Launchpad as the main microcontroller. The device was made to 
replicate the functions of typical Arduino obstacle avoidance vehicles kits, but instead use C programming to program the board. 
The code is relatively simple and structured to allow changes to the code.
